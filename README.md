# reqman (3.X)
Reqman is a postman killer ;-)

**Reqman** is a [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) killer. It shares the same goal, but without GUI ... the GUI is simply your favorite text editor, because requests/tests are only simple yaml files. **Reqman** is a command line tool, available on any platforms.

All configurations is done via simple yaml files, editable with any text editors. Results are displayed in console and in an html output. It's scriptable, and can be used as a daemon/cron task to automate your tests.

   * NEW 3.0 : (simple py file -> real python module (multiple files))
        * full rewrite of resolving mechanism (more robust, more maintanable) (the big improvment)
        - "wait:" commands (time expressed in ms)
        * "ignorable vars" (avoid ResolveException, with `<<var?>>`)
        * --f option : to output full exchanges in html output
        * --j && --j:file.xml : to output junit-xml file

**TODO** : need to rewrite this ^^ ;-)

## Getting started : installation

If you are on an *nix platform, you can start with pip :

    $ pip3 install reqman

it will install the _reqman_ script in your path (perhaps, you'll need to Add the path `~/.local/bin` to the _PATH_ environment variable.)

If you are on microsoft windows, just download [reqman.exe (v3)](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/master/dist/NOT_AVAILABLE_YET).
 [The old reqman.exe V2, is still there](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/ac7d96319bf53e08f5a01ff55c54ef820e839fa6/dist/reqman.exe), and add it in your path.
 [The old reqman.exe V1, is still there](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/reqman1.4.4.0/dist/reqman.exe), and add it in your path.


## Getting started : let's go

Imagine that you want to test the [json api from pypi.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPIJSON), to verify that [it finds me](https://pypi.org/pypi/reqman/json) ;-)
(if you are on windows, just replace `reqman` with `reqman.exe`)

You can start a new project in your folder, like that:

    $ reqman new https://pypi.org/pypi/reqman/json

It's the first start ; it will create a conf file _reqman.conf_ and a (basic) test file _0010_test.rml_. Theses files are [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), so ensure that your editor understand them !
(Following 'new' command will just create another fresh rml file if a _reqman.conf_ exists)

Now, you can run/test it :

    $ reqman .

It will scan your folder "." and run all test files (`*.rml` or `*.yml`) against the _reqman.conf_ ;-)

It will show you what's happened in your console. And generate a `reqman.html` with more details (open it to have an idea)!

If you edit the `reqman.conf`, you will see :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)
```

the **root** is a `special var` which will be prependded to all relative urls in your requests tests.
the **headers** (which is a `special var` too) is a set of `http headers` which will be added to all your requests.

Change it to, and save it :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org
```

Now, you have created your first _switch_. And try to run your tests like this:

    $ reqman.py . -test

It will run your tests against the _root_ defined in _test_ section ; and the test is KO, because _reqman_ doesn't exist on test.pypi.org !
In fact; all declared things under _test_ will replace those at the top ! So you can declare multiple environments, with multiple switches !

But you can declare what you want, now edit _reqman.conf_ like this :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

package: reqman

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org
```

You have declared a _var_ **package** ! let's edit the test file _0010_test.rml_ like this :

```yaml
- GET: /pypi/<<package>>/json
  tests:
    - status: 200
```

Now, your test will use the **package** var which was declared in _reqman.conf_ ! So, you can create a _switch_ to change the package thru the command line, simply edit your _reqman.conf_ like that :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

package: reqman

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org

    colorama:
        package: colorama
```

Now, you can check that 'colorama' exists on pypi.org, like that :

    $ reqman . -colorama

And you can check that 'colorama' exists on test.pypi.org, like that :

    $ reqman . -colorama -test

As you can imagine, it's possible to make a lot of fun things easily. (see a more complex [reqman.conf](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/master/examples/reqman.conf))


Now, you can edit your rml file, and try the things available in this [tuto](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/reqman1.4.4.0/examples/tuto.yml).
Organize your tests as you want : you can make many requests in a rml file, you can make many files with many requests, you can make folders which contain many rml files. _Reqman_ will not scan sub-folders starting with "_" or ".".

_reqman_ will return an `exit code` which contains the number of KO tests : 0 if everything is OK, or -1 if there is a trouble (tests can't be runned) : so it's easily scriptable in your automated workflows !


# Ability to override reqman's features for your propers needs (reqman>=2.8.1)
Now, it's super easy to override reqman with your own features. Using 'reqman' as a lib/module for your python's code.
You can declare your own methods, to fulfill your specials needs (hide special mechanism, use external libs, ...):
(Thoses real python methods, just needs to respect the same signature as pyhon methods declared in confs.)

```python
import reqman

reqman.__usage__ = "USAGE: reqmanBis ..."   # override usage or not ;-)

@reqman.expose
def SpecialMethod(x,ENV):
    """
    Do what you want ...

    Args:
        'x'   : the input var (any) or None.
        'ENV' : the current env (dict)

    Returns:
        any
    """
    ...
    return "What you need"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(reqman.main())
```

Now, you can use `SpecialMethod` in your scripts, ex: `<<value|SpecialMethod>>` or `<<SpecialMethod>>`!

Use and abuse !
