# An online Demo

Here is a showcase : an online GUI to test **reqman** : [test-reqman.glitch.me](https://test-reqman.glitch.me)

BUT It's limited :

 * You can't use python methods in tests (security concerns)
 * You can't use multiple switches in commandline (just one, for fun)
 * You can't test others options of the commandline

!!! warning
    Keep in mind that **reqman** was designed to be a commandline tool, to be runned in console, on any platforms!

Otherwise, it can be useful too, to quickly design a test suite or to report a bug in a test suite.
